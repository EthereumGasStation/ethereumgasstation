Ethereum Gasstation - exchange ERC20 tokens for gas
===================================================

.. include:: include_announcement.rst

Ethereum Gasstation is a library and accompanying webservice that allows you to run a gasstation.

An Ethereum gasstation sells small amounts of ETH in exchange for tokens. It is a convenience service for people that have an Ethereum account that has some ERC20-compatible tokens, but does not have an ETH balance, so it cannot send tokens elsewhere.
