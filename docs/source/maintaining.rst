===========================
Maintaining your gasstation
===========================

-------------------
Monitoring balances
-------------------

Basic maintenance of your gasstation is to make sure that:

* The signer account has enough ETH (gas) to sign transactions on behalf of your clients
* The gasstation smart contract has enough ETH (gas) to sell.

Withdraw tokens

Periodically you should withdraw the tokens you have received.
